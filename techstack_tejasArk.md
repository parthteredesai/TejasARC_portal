## Acknowledgements
We, Team TejasArk would like to express our sincere gratitude to the **IEEE Sensors Council** and the **MYOSA 4.0** team for providing the platform and resources to develop this project. The MYOSA Mini Kit and open-source environment were instrumental in the prototyping of TejasArk. 

We are also thankful to our mentor, [Ms. Valentina Basker](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088858636) as well as our college [St. Francis Institute Of Technology](https://www.sfit.ac.in/) for their invaluable guidance and support.

## Overview

Solar PV systems often suffer from unnoticed performance degradation caused by dust buildup, environmental stress, and hidden technical faults, leading to reduced energy output and higher maintenance costs. This project addresses the problem through a sensor-driven IoT framework that continuously monitors temperature, voltage, current, irradiance, and environmental parameters to detect faults and efficiency loss in real time. AI-based analytics are applied as a secondary layer to predict performance decline and recommend timely maintenance, resulting in a low-cost, self-diagnostic solution that improves reliability and minimizes downtime.
